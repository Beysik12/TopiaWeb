              <h2>Lover, art and stories: decoded: The Age of AI</h2>
              <p>
                Though its importance is growing daily, will artificial intelligence ever be able to produce works of art? Machine learning is what determines the response to that query. Even while AI is capable of producing works of art, its operations are not yet fully autonomous. There is no proof that AI will ever generate art that is on par with human creativity because it still has its own prejudices. Nevertheless, as technology develops, AI-generated art will surely get better. The process of creating AI-generated art is fairly simple. Simply describe the subject and choose a style, and within 20 seconds the application displays the finished product. It is amazing to see how quickly this technology can evolve and produce art. It can also be used to create art for the public to view. Ultimately, AI-generated art can be a valuable addition to any museum. So far, no museum has offered a complete AI-generated artwork.
  
  Now that the vehicle is autonomous, a steering console is not required, hence none is found. However, there is something "inside" the carâ€”just the two seats. Because they look like bucket seats, these seats are designed to make you feel as though you are floating. To do this, a suspension system is installed directly behind the buckets.The black arms that protrude from the back of the EXP and connect to the seats are the suspension systems, which are visible from the side or rear views of the car. We don't know what's inside or how they work, but on paper, they appear to be functional.
